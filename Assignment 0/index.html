        <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large;"><b> Bramshill House</b>, in <a href="">Bramshill</a>, northeast Hampshire, England, is one of the largest and most important <a href="">Jacobean prodigy house</a> mansions in England. It was built in the early 17th century by <a href="">Baron Edward la Zouche</a> of <a href="">Harringworth</a> but was partly destroyed by fire a few years later. The design shows the influence of the <a href="">Italian Renaissance</a>, which became popular in England during the late 16th century. The house was designated a Grade I <a href="">listed building</a> in 1952.<br><br>  
            The mansion's southern façade is notable for its decorative architecture, which includes at its centre a large <a href="">oriel window</a> above the principal entrance. Interior features include a great hall displaying 92 coats of arms on a Jacobean screen, an ornate drawing room, and a 126.5-foot-long (38.6 m) gallery containing many portraits. Numerous columns and <a href="">friezes</a> are found throughout the mansion, while several rooms have large <a href="">tapestries</a> depicting historical figures and events on their panelled walls. The house is set in 262 acres (106 ha) of grounds containing an 18-acre (7.3 ha) lake. The grounds, which received a Grade II* listing in 1984, are part of a <a href="">Registered Historic Park</a> that includes about 25 acres (10 ha) of early 17th-century formal gardens near the house. The wider medieval park was landscaped from the 17th to the 20th century and contains woodland. <br><br>
               Bramshill appears to have been a local sporting and social venue since the 16th century. The <a href="">cricket</a> ground at the house played host to a <a href="">first-class</a> match in 1823 when an early <a href="">Hampshire</a> team played an <a href="">England XI</a>, and it hosted three other matches in 1825–26. During the Second World War, the mansion was used as a Red Cross maternity home, before becoming the residence of the exiled King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania for a number of years. It became the location of the Police Staff College in 1960, and was later home to the European Police College. As a result, many campus buildings have been added to the estate. Owing to escalating maintenance costs the property was sold to the heritage property developers City & Country in August 2014. Among the 14 ghosts reputed to haunt the house is that of a bride who accidentally locked herself in a chest on her wedding night and was not found until 50 years later.</p>
